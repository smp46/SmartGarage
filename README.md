# SmartGarage (Very Work in Progress!)
This repo will be home to my smart home garage project, which will be made up of two parts:

- Training and implementing a machine learning model to identify if my garage door is open or not (using PyTorch)
  
- (Reverse?) Engineering a way to use a Raspberry Pi to send a remote open/close signal.

One day there might be a write up here. Wish me luck.
